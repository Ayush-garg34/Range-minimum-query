# Range-minimum-query
This repository contains an implementation of algorithm which solves range minimum queries in &lt;O(log(log(n))> query time with &lt;O(n)> pre-processing time. Range minimum query is the problem in which, given a sequence of numbers and 2 integers (i,j) representing indices for the query in the sequence, we have to find the minimum element in the subsequence (i,j).
